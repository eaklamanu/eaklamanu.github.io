#Intro
I believe life is simple — though not always easy. Some of its biggest questions often have simple yet profound answers: Why am I here? What does a successful life look like?
Before anything else, I am a Christian. I believe our purpose on earth is to glorify God, and I strive to let that shape how I live and work. I also happen to be a quintessential introvert who enjoys simulating conversations, ideas, and problems in my head — you might say I carry a “model of the world” within me.
If you’d like to talk about faith, ideas, or engineering, I’d be glad to connect with you here(elormaklamanu626@gmail.com).

#My Journey
My path into robotics and control systems has been a gradual one, shaped by early interests in Mathematics and Physics. These subjects led me to study Electrical and Electronic Engineering, where I discovered the fascinating world of Control Systems.
I am captivated by how simple inputs can influence complex systems — how a small adjustment, like turning a knob, can move something as large as a satellite. What excites me most is how individual components, when brought together, form systems that are greater than the sum of their parts. I am currently seeking an opportunity to pursue graduate studies, with the goal of deepening my knowledge of control systems and applying them to real-world challenges.

#What Drives Me
Efficiency — that single word captures my motivation for pursuing Control Systems. I believe technology can take on tasks more effectively than humans alone, freeing time, reducing errors, and solving many of the world’s challenges. Technology, when rightly applied, can be our generation’s gift to the next by enhancing quality of life and raising the standard of living.
My goal is to design control systems that solve real-world problems, and also create opportunities that make everyday life a little easier.

#I Like
I enjoy reading and journaling, sometimes writing poems and short stories along the way. Writing helps me express my emotions in a constructive way. I love running because it makes me feel like I'm pushing my limits. Classical music keeps me grounded and helps me focus. I love cooking especially when I can share the food with others.

# Beyond the Books and Code
I love reading my Bible and am currently on a daily plan to finish reading it this year 2025. At the core of who I am is my faith in Jesus and the Church of Christ. I also love the stars and the sky, and hope to one day visit an observatory. Art captivates me too — paintings and drawings draw me in, and I’m the type who can stare at a piece and immerse myself in its world. I write poems, stories, and letters; in fact, most of my journal entries are written as letters. There is so much beauty in this world, yet many rarely pause to lift their eyes and see the stars. I try to notice the beauty in God’s creation, and it keeps life in perspective for me.

#I think
One of man's greatest inventions was the printing press. Today, knowledge can be shared with ease, outliving the compiler who first gathered it.

#My favorite
- Book - The Bible
- Novel - The Secret Garden

#Bucket List
- Learn how to read music
- Learn to play the piano or violin
- Learn sign language

#Lessons I live by
- There is a cure-all for all of life's problems: knowing God.
- The Bible has all the answers you need.
- Don't be comfortable with not having answers to certain questions: What is the point of life? [If you want to give the Bible a chance, read the Book of Ecclesiastes. It answers it succinctly]

#Looking Ahead
I hope to pursue a career in Control Systems, where I can combine teaching and research to inspire the next generation of engineers. My vision is to contribute to the intersection of Control Systems, Robotics, and Human Well-being by advancing knowledge while creating practical solutions. For me, engineering is not only about solving equations, but further using those equations to improve lives and shape a better future.

<h2 align = 'center'>The Touch of the Master's Hand</h2>
<center>'Twas battered and scarred, and the auctioneer  </center>
<center>Thought it scarcely worth his while  </center>
<center>To waste much time on the old violin,  </center>
<center>But held it up with a smile.  </center>
<center>"What am I bidden, good folks," he cried,</center>
<center>"Who'll start the bidding for me?"  </center>
<center>"A dollar, a dollar. Then two! Only two?  </center>
<center>Two dollars, and who'll make it three?"  </center>
<br>
<center>"Three dollars, once; three dollars, twice;</center>
<center>Going for three…" But no,</center>
<center>From the room, far back, a grey-haired man</center>
<center>Came forward and picked up the bow;  </center>
<center>Then wiping the dust from the old violin,  </center>
<center>And tightening the loosened strings,  </center>
<center>He played a melody pure and sweet,  </center>
<center>As a caroling angel sings.  </center>
<br>
<center>The music ceased, and the auctioneer,</center>
<center>With a voice that was quiet and low,  </center>
<center>Said: "What am I bid for the old violin?"  </center>
<center>And he held it up with the bow.  </center>
<center>"A thousand dollars, and who'll make it two?  </center>
<center>Two thousand! And who'll make it three?  </center>
<center>Three thousand, once; three thousand, twice,  </center>
<center>And going and gone," said he.  </center>
<br>
<center>The people cheered, but some of them cried,</center>
<center>"We do not quite understand.  </center>
<center>What changed its worth?" Swift came the reply:  </center>
<center>"The touch of the Master's hand."  </center>
<center>And many a man with life out of tune,  </center>
<center>And battered and scarred with sin,  </center>
 <center>Is auctioned cheap to the thoughtless crowd  </center>
<center>Much like the old violin.  </center>
<br>
<center>A "mess of pottage," a glass of wine,</center>
<center>A game — and he travels on.  </center> 
<center>He is "going" once, and "going" twice,  </center>
<center>He's "going" and almost "gone."  </center>
<center>But the Master comes, and the foolish crowd  </center> 
<center>Never can quite understand  </center>
<center>The worth of a soul and the change that is wrought</center>
<center>By the touch of the Master's hand.</center>

# Some of my pieces
## Bleeding on paper 

<h3 align='center'>What If</h3>

    What if I were brave enough  
	To speak my truth, unbound, unafraid,  
	To say to whomever, all that I feel?

	What if I could loosen my grip,  
	Care a little less,  
	Turn my feelings on and off,  
	Like the flick of a switch,  
	Whenever the weight grew too heavy?  

	What if my heart could surrender with ease,  
	Give up, move on,  
	And run—just run—  
	Far away, even for a little while?  

	What if I could see the beauty,  
	Let it fill my eyes,  
	And choose to let go of the pain  
	That stains the peace of each fleeting moment?  

	If I could do all this,  
	Would the ache finally fade?  
	Or is this struggle,  
	This constant fight,  
	What it means to keep being me?
<br>
<br>
<br>
## Peace, Perfect Peace    
<h3 align= 'center'>Sweet Communion</h3>
	Invincible, yet so fragile,
	We fit together like a puzzle.
	Together, we're strong, never to quaver,
	But storms within make us waver.
	When we're apart, pangs of despair loom -
	Emptiness fills the void; all I see is gloom.

	Our hearts are bound by steel cords 
	That yearn me back, a wailing twanging to come home
	Hand in hand, we're complete,
	Head on Your shoulder, comfort abounds
	Arms around You, a fountain of joy springs
	In each other’s presence - I've found home


I hope you liked them!
