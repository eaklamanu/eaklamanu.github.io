# Intro

I believe the very things that scare you, that chase you, are the very things you should face heads on. Why keep fleeing when you can rather chase?
So, I decided the very things I'm scard of are the very things I'll do. If it's speaking to a gathering, or travelling to a new location without any map, I'll do it.
Really, what's there to loose if you take the chances, in fact you were never going to gain if you don't try in the first place. This concept keeps me going, so I try, even if all odds are against me.(Add somthing?)

# My favourite poem

<h2 align='center'>Our Deepest Fear</h2>
<center>"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.</center>
<center>Our deepest fear in that we are powerful beyond measure.</center>
<center>It is our Light, not our Darkness, that most frightens us.</center>
<center>We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?</center>
<center>Actually, who are you not to be?</center>
<br>
<center>You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the World.</center>
<center>There is nothing enlightening about shrinking</center>
<center>so that other people wonâ€™t feel unsure around you.</center>
<center>We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us.</center>
<center>It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone.</center>
<br>
<center>As we let our own Light shine,</center>
<center>we consciously give other people permission to do the same.</center>
<center>As we are liberated from our own fear,
our presence automatically liberates others."</center>
<br>
<center>`A Return to Love - Marianne Williamson`</center>
