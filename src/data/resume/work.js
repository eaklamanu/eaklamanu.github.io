    summary: `I tutored students and faciliated their lab sessions in the following courses: Digital Systems Design, Computer Architecture, Linear Electroncs, Operating Systems and VLSI. Typically, the number of students who take VLSI and hardware related courses are less than 20. I was able to spark interest in more 10 students to persue hardware related fields, I helped them understand why they are doing all the courses they do and how they all come together beautifully to create complex systems we see now. In some cases we went back to the first principles. I was able to help students understand the concepts better and also help them with their lab assignments.`,
